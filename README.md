Implements a collection of Python functions for numeric validation, sequence processing, and matrix-based search.

Features:

  Validates numeric sequences using digit-based checksum logic
  
  Processes integer lists (median computation, duplicate removal, frequency counting)
  
  Performs matrix transformations and pattern search across rows, columns, and diagonals
  
  Supports coordinate-based validation for overlapping numeric sequences

Skills demonstrated:

  Algorithmic problem solving with lists and matrices
  
  Careful handling of edge cases and input constraints
  
  Modular function design and code reuse
  
  Use of doctest for correctness checking
